# WIP Limiter

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/apiology/wip-limiter.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apiology/wip-limiter)

Get a visual hint when your Kanban-style WIP limit has been exceeded
in your task-tracking tool.  Currently supports Asana.

## Using

Add a number surrounded in square brackets at the end of your section
name (e.g, `My section name [5]`).

If you add five total tasks to that section, you'll see a yellow
warning stripe on the left.  If you add more than five, that stripe
will turn red.
