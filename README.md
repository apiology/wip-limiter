Chrome extension to get a visual hint when your Kanban-style WIP limit has been exceeded.

add the 'fast' tag to it, indicating the task won't take long to knock
out!

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Click the Load unpacked button.
3. Choose the directory containing your Chrome extension code.
4. Now you can work on your extension.
